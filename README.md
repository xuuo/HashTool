## 📋 What is HashTool?

HashTool is a Windows program designed to check and verify files quickly and accurately. It uses a method called hashing, which creates a unique fingerprint for each file. You can compare these fingerprints to make sure files are the same or have not been changed.

This tool supports two common types of hashes: MD5 and SHA256. It works fast by checking many files at the same time. HashTool is perfect if you want to confirm file integrity for backups, downloads, or shared files.

## 🚀 How to Use HashTool

Once installed or launched, you can start verifying your files with a few simple steps. No technical knowledge required.

### Step 1: Add Files

- Click the **Add Files** button.
- Select one or many files you want to check.
- You can also add whole folders to check every file inside.

### Step 2: Choose Hash Type

- MD5 is faster but less secure.
- SHA256 is slower but stronger and more reliable.

### Step 3: Start Checking

- Click the **Start** button.
- HashTool will read each file and show its hash code.
- If you have a list of expected hashes, you can paste it in to compare and verify.

### Step 4: Review Results
